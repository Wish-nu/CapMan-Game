# CapMan - A Multi-Level Python Game

**CapMan** is a Pac-Man inspired game built in Python using the Pygame library. It features five levels with increasing difficulty, where players guide CapMan to eat food while avoiding ghosts. The game is designed to progressively get harder from Level 3 onward.

## Features:
- Five levels with different layouts and ghost speeds
- Score system: Scores are maintained across levels
- Each level lasts for 10 seconds
- Increasing difficulty, starting very easy and reaching a challenging final level
- "CapMan" title screen on game start


## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the Pygame library:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## Clone the respository to your local machine
git clone 

## Run the capman.py file using Python
python capman.py

## Game Controls
Arrow Keys: Move CapMan (up, down, left, right)

## How the Levels Work:
Level 1: Very easy, slow-moving ghosts
Level 2: Slightly faster ghosts
Level 3: Moderate ghost speed
Level 4: Faster ghosts
Level 5: Fastest speed, the hardest level

## Future Enhancements
Add sound effects for CapMan eating and ghost movements
