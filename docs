# CapMan Game Documentation

## Overview
CapMan is a Python game inspired by Pac-Man. It includes multiple levels of increasing difficulty and is built using the Pygame library.

## Project Structure
- `capman.py`: The main game code containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the game.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies needed to run the game.

## How to Run the Game
1. **Install Python and Pygame**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

##Run the Game:
Execute the following command in your terminal to start the game:  python capman.py

##Code Explanation
Importing Pygame:

The pygame library is imported to enable game development features.
Initialization:
pygame.init() initializes all the Pygame modules. This is necessary before using any Pygame functions.

Screen Constants:
SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT are constants defining the dimensions of the game window.

Main Function:
The main() function serves as the entry point of the game. It sets up the display and contains the main game loop.

Game Loop:
The game runs inside a while running: loop, which continues until the user quits.
The event handling checks for user input (like closing the window).

Quitting Pygame:
pygame.quit() is called to safely close the Pygame window and clean up resources when the game ends.

##Future Enhancements
Gameplay Features: Consider adding player controls, scoring systems, and power-ups to enhance the game experience.
Level Design: Implement unique layouts and challenges for each level to keep the gameplay engaging.
Graphics and Sounds: Explore adding graphics, animations, and sound effects to improve the overall user experience.
